#Flappy Block 

Flappy Block is a side-scrolling game. 

The objective is to direct a flying block which moves continuously to the right, between sets of building walls. If the player touches the walls, they end the game. 

The block briefly rises upward each time that the player presses key SPACE. If the key SPACE is not pressed, the block falls because of gravity on the ground. The player is scored based on the number of walls that the block successfully passes through.

There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game as the walls, except first two, always have the same gap between them and there is no end to the running track, having only at the end the rising score as rewards.
